# Abstract to model on
Purpose: Soccer participation continues to increase among all ages in the US. Our objective was to analyze trends in soccer-related facial injury epidemiology, demographics, and mechanisms of injury.

Materials and methods: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System was evaluated for soccer-related facial injuries from 2010 through 2014. Results for product code "soccer" were filtered for injures to the face. Number of injuries was extrapolated, and data were analyzed for age, sex, specific injury diagnoses, locations, and mechanisms.

Results: In all, 2054 soccer-related facial trauma entries were analyzed. During this time, the number of injures remained relatively stable. Lacerations were the most common diagnosis (44.2%), followed by contusions and fractures. The most common sites of fracture were the nose (75.1%). Of fractures with a reported mechanism of injury, the most common was head-to-head collisions (39.0%). Patients <19 years accounted for 66.9% of injuries, and athletes over 18 years old had a higher risk of fractures.

Conclusions: The incidence of soccer-related facial trauma has remained stable, but the severity of such injuries remain a danger. Facial protection in soccer is virtually absent, and our findings reinforce the need to educate athletes, families, and physicians on injury awareness and prevention.

# Materials and Methods
The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), a nationwide resource offered by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, was evaluated for emergency department (ED) visits related to accidental ingestion of birth control tablets. The NEISS collects data from a representative sample of EDs and weighs results based on ED setting, providing weighted national incidence. This database has been of great importance in numerous prior analyses.(citation needed)

In August 2020, the most recent 10-year period of data was searched using the product code “tablets” with focus on accidental ingestion of birth control. Data were recorded and evaluated for patient age, sex, injury type, and a brief narrative description of the incident. Injuries unrelated to ingestion of birth control were excluded from the study (eg, patient on birth control and developed a pulmonary embolism). 

Statistical Analysis
Fisher’s exact test and 2-tailed Student’s t test were used for comparison of categorical and continuous variables, as appropriate, with significance set at P < .05. Weighted national incidence estimates are provided by the NEISS from each query conducted. Exploratory.io version 6.1.1.4 was used for statistical calculations.

Ethical Considerations
Because this study is comprised solely of publicly searchable data freely available through online databases, it qualifies as nonhuman subject research and thus was exempted from requiring institutional review board approval.

Prior to 2019, each NEISS record allowed a maximum of one diagnosis and body part. In 2019 the NEISS began collecting up to two diagnoses and body parts per record. As a result, a NEISS record may be counted multiple times in producing national injury estimates and calculating variability of those estimates. A single record may be counted in up to two different diagnosis/body part combinations.
