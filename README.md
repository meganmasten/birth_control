# Abstract to model on
Purpose: Soccer participation continues to increase among all ages in the US. Our objective was to analyze trends in soccer-related facial injury epidemiology, demographics, and mechanisms of injury.

Materials and methods: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System was evaluated for soccer-related facial injuries from 2010 through 2014. Results for product code "soccer" were filtered for injures to the face. Number of injuries was extrapolated, and data were analyzed for age, sex, specific injury diagnoses, locations, and mechanisms.

Results: In all, 2054 soccer-related facial trauma entries were analyzed. During this time, the number of injures remained relatively stable. Lacerations were the most common diagnosis (44.2%), followed by contusions and fractures. The most common sites of fracture were the nose (75.1%). Of fractures with a reported mechanism of injury, the most common was head-to-head collisions (39.0%). Patients <19 years accounted for 66.9% of injuries, and athletes over 18 years old had a higher risk of fractures.

Conclusions: The incidence of soccer-related facial trauma has remained stable, but the severity of such injuries remain a danger. Facial protection in soccer is virtually absent, and our findings reinforce the need to educate athletes, families, and physicians on injury awareness and prevention.

Keywords: NEISS; National Electronic Injury Surveillance System; facial trauma; soccer; soccer-related injury.

# Materials and Methods
The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), a nationwide resource offered by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, was evaluated for emergency department (ED) visits related to accidental ingestion of birth control tablets. The NEISS collects data from a representative sample of EDs and weighs results based on ED setting, providing weighted national incidence. This database has been of great importance in numerous prior analyses.(citation needed)

In August 2020, the most recent 10-year period of data was searched using the product code “tablets” (NEISS code 1931) with focus on accidental ingestion "poisoning" (NEISS code 68) of birth control. Data were recorded and evaluated for patient age, sex, injury type, and a brief narrative description of the incident. Injuries unrelated to ingestion of birth control were excluded from the study (eg, patient on birth control and developed a pulmonary embolism). 

Statistical Analysis
Fisher’s exact test and 2-tailed Student’s t test were used for comparison of categorical and continuous variables, as appropriate, with significance set at P < .05. Weighted national incidence estimates are provided by the NEISS from each query conducted. Exploratory.io version 6.1.1.4 was used for statistical calculations.

Ethical Considerations
Because this study is comprised solely of publicly searchable data freely available through online databases, it qualifies as nonhuman subject research and thus was exempted from requiring institutional review board approval.

# Results
During the 10-year period studied, we reviewed ?? NEISS recorded ED poisenings by birth control tables, which was extrapolated to a national incidence of ??? birth control-related poisonings per year. The number of US ED visits for birth control-related poisonings remained stable from 2010 to 2019 (Figure 1). The majority of patients during this 10-year period were male (74.4%), with the remaining 25.6% female.

Age-related trends
Patients aged 18 and under accounted for 66.9% of injures, while 33.1% were adults over 18 years of age. The mean and median ages of those injured were 18.4 (±.21) and 16 years (interquartile range, 13-22), respectively. Of the pediatric population, 53.3% of injuries were involving children under 15 years of age while 46.7% were involving high school–aged athletes, from 15 to 18 years of age. Adults over 18 years of age had a higher risk of lacerations (52.7% vs 40.0%, P < .0001) and fractures (27.2% vs 17.2%, P < .0001), while patients 18 years of age and under had a significantly higher risk of contusions (31.8% vs 15.9% P < .0001) (Table 1). Similarly, males were significantly more likely to suffer from lacerations (49.2% vs 29.8%, P < .0001), and females were more likely to sustain a contusion (39.1% vs 22.2%, P < .0001) (Table 2).



## Methods from Svider battery study
We searched this database for BRI and evaluated results
specifically relating to the head and neck. We were able to
search for injuries with the anatomic designations including
“head,” “neck,” “ear,” “face,” and “mouth. ” We excluded ophthalmologic injuries in this analysis. Furthermore, all of the patient
narratives for “face” injuries were examined to further filter out
nasal injuries. This database provided annual sample sizes as
well as derived national estimates for battery injuries throughout the body. The annual sample size of injuries organized by
anatomic site was divided by the annual sample size of BRI for
all sites, and this proportion was multiplied by the nationwide
estimate to come up with specific values for injury incidence
organized by anatomic site. For example, the NEISS reported
74 birth control-related ED visits for ingestion 2019—and provided a derived estimate of 15,058 nationwide
ED visits from this number. Because 29 of these 470 visits
(6.2%) were related to injuries of the face, we multiplied 15,058
by 6.2% to come up with a figure of 929 battery-instigated facial
injuries for 2012. In addition to annual estimates, we also analyzed data by patient demographics (including age and gender),
injury diagnosis, and patient disposition. We examined data
from the most recent available 10-year block (2003–2012). Data
collection was completed in December 2013.

Prior to 2019, each NEISS record allowed a maximum of one diagnosis, one body part, and two product codes. In 2019 the NEISS began collecting up to two diagnoses and body parts, and three product codes per record. As a result, a NEISS record may be counted multiple times in producing national injury estimates and calculating variability of those estimates. A single record may be counted in up to three product groups, product sub-groups, or individual product codes. Likewise, an individual NEISS record may be counted in up to two different diagnosis/body part combinations.
